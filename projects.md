## NanoRange (2018-present) ##

GitHub: [github.com/tcbrindle/nanorange](https://github.com/tcbrindle/nanorange)

NanoRange is a C++17 implementation of the new "ranges" functionality in the C++20 standard library. Compatible with all major compilers, it includes all of the new concepts (implemented via template metaprogramming), algorithms, range adaptors and almost everything else. It's available either as a single-header drop-in replacement for `<algorithm>`, or via the Conan or vcpkg package managers.

## span.hpp (2018-present) ##

GitHub: [github.com/tcbrindle/span.hpp](github.com/tcbrindle/span.hpp)

A C++11-compatible implementation of C++20's new [std::span](http://eel.is/c++draft/views.span) type. It's a single header you can drop into your project, and features optional bounds-checking which is customisable via macros.

## raytracer.hpp (2018) ##

GitHub: [github.com/tcbrindle/raytracer.hpp](https://github.com/tcbrindle/raytracer.hpp)

A fun weekend project, this is a C++17 reimplementation of a simple raytracer example I found online, with the twist that it can operate entirely at compile-time via `constexpr` functions. Somehow briefly ended up as the top item on Hacker News, a year after I wrote it.

## numeris_romanis (2019) ##

GitHub: [github.com/tcbrindle/numeris_romanis](https://github.com/tcbrindle/numeris_romanis)

C++ has long lacked the ability to embed movie copyright dates in source code, and perform calculations with them. *Numeris Romanis* rectifies this by offering roman numeral support for C++17 and later. Approved by Tim Sweeney.

## libsudoku (2017) ##

GitHub: [github.com/tcbrindle/libsudoku](https://github.com/tcbrindle/libsudoku)

A small, fast library for solving sudoku puzzles, implemented using Range-V3. Features both C++ and C APIs.

## utf-ranges (2017) ##

GitHub: [github.com/tcbrindle/utf_ranges](https://github.com/tcbrindle/utf_ranges)

A collection of views and algorithms for dealing with Unicode text using Range-V3

## OggConvert (2007-2010) ##

GitHub: [github.com/tcbrindle/oggconvert](https://github.com/tcbrindle/oggconvert)

A GTK/Python GUI for converting media files to Ogg Vorbis/Theora formats written back in 2007. Moderately popular back in the day, it's still available in some Linux distros, and still has its own [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OggConvert).
