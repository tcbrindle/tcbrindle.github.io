I'm a freelance programmer and trainer based in London, mostly focussing on C++. I'm a member of the UK national body (BSI) and ISO WG21. Occasionally I can be found at C++ conferences. I'm also a director of [C++ London Uni](https://www.cpplondonuni.com/), a not-for-profit organisation offering free beginner programming classes in London and online.

I've got a few fun projects on GitHub that you can find out about [here](/projects/).
